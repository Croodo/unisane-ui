# Archived Documentation

This folder contains legacy documentation that has been superseded by updated docs.

## Contents

| File | Original Purpose | Superseded By |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| `ROADMAP.md` | Original SaaS kit roadmap | `roadmaps/MASTER-ROADMAP.md` |
| `migration.md` | Migration notes | `roadmaps/centralization-plan.md` |
| `MIGRATION-STEPS.md` | Step-by-step migration guide | `roadmaps/centralization-plan.md` |
| `current-status.md` | UI development status (Dec 2025) | `architecture/implementation-status.md` |
| `final-status.md` | UI final status report (Dec 2025) | `architecture/implementation-status.md` |

## Why Archived?

These files were created during the initial SaaS kit development and contain outdated information about the old monorepo structure. The current monorepo has evolved significantly:

- Package structure is now different
- Architecture uses multi-platform model
- Implementation status is tracked in `architecture/implementation-status.md`
- Active roadmaps are in `roadmaps/` directory

## Should I Read These?

Only if you need historical context about early design decisions. For current information, use:

- [MASTER-ROADMAP.md](../roadmaps/MASTER-ROADMAP.md) - Overall direction
- [implementation-status.md](../architecture/implementation-status.md) - What's built
- [centralization-plan.md](../roadmaps/centralization-plan.md) - Active migration work
